This directory may or may not contain the precompiled expat Windoze binary
and helper files depending on where you obtained this package from.

To compile all the examples and apps copy/move libexpat.dll to this directory
or somewhere else in your PATH.

Expat is under GPL and available at http://expat.sourceforge.net.

Happy calling
Ewald Arnold
