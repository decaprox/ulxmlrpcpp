Following are two files that can be used as a demo of your package (C++)
and a Java client. It is based on the demo from package http://xml.apache.org/xmlrpc/,
and it requires .jar file to run it.

You can run it (after build):

./sum_server &
java -cp xmlrpc-1.1.jar:. SumClient

To build the java client:

javac -classpath xmlrpc-1.1.jar SumClient.java
