This directory may or may not contain the precompiled expat Windoze binary
and helper files for Borland C++ 5.0 depending on where you obtained this
package from.

Due to the fact that I could not link with the original binaries from the
expat site I compiled myself. In case you have the same problems and can't
compile yourself you might use my files. If they are not already here you
can download them from

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/ulxmlrpcpp

or take the project files and compile yourself from the expat distribution.

To compile all the examples and apps copy/move libexpat.dll, libexpat.lib 
and expat.h to this directory.

Expat is under GPL and available at http://expat.sourceforge.net.

Happy calling
Ewald Arnold
